# micro-frontends-using-webcomponents

This project is to demo assembling two micro-frontends as one SPA.

The micro-frontends are implemented using vanilla web components.

Each micro-frontend is deployed independently with their own sub-domains:

1. https://mapteb.github.io/micro-frontends-using-webcomponents/productsApp.html

2. https://ns-code.github.io/micro-frontends-cartapp/cartApp.html

The above two front-ends are assembled and displayed as one SPA at: https://mapteb.github.io/micro-frontends-using-webcomponents/index.html
